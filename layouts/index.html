    <p><strong>ABOUT:</strong> The "wasn't so hard" Database has been built with inputs from several different databases, and with support from various parties, and contains actions identified from March 4 to August 4, 2020 as a direct response to the Covid-19 pandemic in the mobility sector. The majority of the actions come from a dataset hosted by the Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center at the University of North Carolina, complemented by Mobility Works' own database and Streetplans's own effort. The database used here was substantially transformed, harmonized and tidied with the help of Henry Velandia, Diana Giraldo, Miguel Cuellar, Sebasti√°n Vega, Carolina Fernandez and led by Carlos F Pardo and Tab Combs. Below are details to the three initiatives that provided the original data, and a suggested credit for this initiative.</p>
