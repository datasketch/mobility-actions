    <p class="my-12 font-georgia">This platform aims to consolidate a list of actions in mobility, public space and other types that somehow changed the mobility landscape upon Covid-19 and as a reaction to the pandemic. Actions have been compiled from a series of databases that were tidied, harmonized and consolidated onto one large database with additional categorization, and thereafter loaded onto a visualization platform to produce maps and graphs.</p>

    <p><strong>ABOUT:</strong> The "wasn't so hard" Database has been built with inputs from several different databases, and with support from various parties, and contains actions identified from March 4 to August 4, 2020 as a direct response to the Covid-19 pandemic in the mobility sector. The majority of the actions come from a dataset hosted by the Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center at the University of North Carolina, complemented by Mobility Works' own database and Streetplans's own effort. The database used here was substantially transformed, harmonized and tidied with the help of Henry Velandia, Diana Giraldo, Miguel Cuellar, Sebastián Vega, Carolina Fernandez and led by Carlos F Pardo and Tab Combs. Below are details to the three initiatives that provided the original data, and a suggested credit for this initiative.</p>
